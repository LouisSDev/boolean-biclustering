# boolean-biclustering

This project was realised as a student project. The goal was to understand and apply bi clustering algorithm on any dataset.

We've built a very simple boolean matrix clustering algorithm, quite ineffective with larger datasets altough it gives some pretty good results with basic dataset as the one we used. 

We implemented it using two different algorithms one being highly inefficient while finding very few clusters, the other being able to check far more possibilities while having decent performances
